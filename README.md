## Project Idea

### UN Sustainable development goal number: 4 (Quality Education)

### Motivation:
Our idea is to create a space for learners to find suitable learning materials for the topics they want to learn. Some find it difficult to know where to begin with learning a topic and how to proceed. Others may find it difficult to retain attention and motivation. No matter one's socioeconomic background, we want everyone to be able to have the same access to resources and be able to collaborate with their peers in their learning journey.

### Features:
1. Allows users to personalise their account by adding topics/skills they have and those they wish to learn/polish.
2. Users can create study guides based on any particular topic, where they may post notes, resources, and links to external material.
3. Users can see, like, follow, clone, and suggest changes to guides posted by other users.
4. Users can match and connect with other users based on the topics they're interested in. Connected users may chat and schedule meetings with each other.
